## Editing an existing page
To edit a page, edit the corresponding markdown (`.md`) file.
Please ensure that the file is valid markdown, as well as ensuring that each sentence is on a new line.

## Creating a new page
To create a new page, create the corresponding markdown file in the respective folder.
You will also need to add a link to the page within the `SUMMARY.md` file.
Please reference the [mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html) if you are unsure how to do this.
