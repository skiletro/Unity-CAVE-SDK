# Configuration
After dragging in the "CAVE\_3W1F" prefab, everything should be working out of the box.
However, there may be some extra steps you need to take if your CAVE setup is more bespoke.

## Multiple Displays
If you are using multiple displays (such as having 1 monitor for the walls and 1 for the floor), you will need to take some extra steps to everything working correctly.
1. Go to `Project Settings` → `Player` → `Resolution and Presentation`.
2. Set the Fullscreen Mode option to `Fullscreen Window`.
