# Installation

## How to use
1. Download this repository, extract the contents, and within Unity's Package Manager add "Install Package from Disk"
2. Include the "CAVE\_3W1F" prefab in your scene or create a variation for your specific number of walls desired.

For interactability, see the `CAVEController.cs` component on the "CAVE\_3W1F" prefab.
Camera projection is handled through the default Unity camera and supports both the Universal and High Definition Render Pipelines (UPR and HDRP), and also any other camera screen effects.
 
### If using multiple displays (e.g. walls and floor),
1. Go to Project Settings > Player > Resolution and Presentation.
2. Set the Fullscreen Mode to "Fullscreen Window".
