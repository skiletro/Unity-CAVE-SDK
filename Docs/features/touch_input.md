# Touch Input
The Unity CAVE SDK supports the Unity [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.8/manual/index.html) for its input events.
As a result, interactables that work with a touchscreen should work with the SDK system out of the box.

In the future a library of prefabs will be available, providing an easy drag-and-drop solution for many common interations you may want in your experience, such as buttons and toggles.
