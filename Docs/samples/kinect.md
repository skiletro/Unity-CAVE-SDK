# Kinect Integration
The CAVE system that this SDK is built around features a version 1 MS Kinect sensor.
To allow use of this from inside unity we implement the MSKinect package and some example scenes to demonstrate how this tool could be used within the CAVE.

## Installation
To install this sample you can go to Unity's package manager where you installed this package and navigate to the 'Samples' tab, here you will find all samples provided with this SDK, including the kinect scenes.
Once the sample has been installed here it will appear inside your project explorer as usual.
