# 360° Video Player
The Unity CAVE SDK includes a rudimentary panorama playback scene to allow the viewing of 360° videos within the CAVE.
As this is only a small demonstration with little features we do not include it as part of the core package.

## Installation
To install this sample you can go to Unity's package manager where you installed this package and navigate to the 'Samples' tab, here you will find all samples provided with this SDK, including the video player.
Once the sample has been installed here it will appear inside your project explorer as usual.

## Usage
In the provided scene you will find `P_360VideoSphere` and its component script `Video Controller`.

This component is the core of the player and where you can change the videos available while running (found under `Dropdown video clips`).
